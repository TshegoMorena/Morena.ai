# 🌍 Morena.ai: Africa’s Cultural AI Assistant

Morena.ai is the first multilingual AI assistant designed for **South Africa’s 11 official languages**.  
It bridges technology with culture by preserving **idioms, proverbs, and oral traditions**, while making AI accessible for **parents, elders, students, and small businesses** who express themselves best in their home languages.

## 🚀 Problem
Current AI tools are **English-centric**.  
- They mistranslate African languages.  
- Elders, rural communities, and small businesses are excluded.  
- Cultural expressions like **proverbs, idioms, and oral history** are erased.  

This creates a **digital divide** and risks cultural erosion.
